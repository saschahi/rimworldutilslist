Kroot mature quickly, with their most rapid period of growth occurring in the first ten years of their lives.

Every Tau is humanoid in shape, with two arms,[17] two cloven feet, and a single head. Their grey-blue skin is leathery and tough and exudes no moisture, owing to the generally dry conditions of their homeworld. Their faces are flat, wide around the eyes, and their olfactory organs are located inside their mouths. Their eyes can see into the infrared and ultraviolet. Tau eyesight is good, but they focus on distant objects slower than humans. The Tau are not very good in close combat, as they find the whole concept uncivilized.\n\nThe Tau has three digits and a single opposable thumb on each hand. The main difference from humans is the bone structure of Tau's lower legs, feet and ankles. Tau have shorter bones of the libia and fibia, but their feet have elongated cuneiform bones and talus and two large central weight-bearing toes. The Tau have eveolved to stand and move without using their heels.[17]",
